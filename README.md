# DCGAN Image Wonderland 🌈✨

Welcome to the DCGAN Image Wonderland! 🚀 This magical repository houses the enchanting journey of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) on its quest to create mesmerizing images.

## ✨ Journey Highlights

1. **Introduction to DCGAN Magic:** Uncover the secrets of the mystical DCGAN realm, where pixels come to life in a symphony of creativity.

2. **Architects of the Enchantment:** Meet the masterminds behind the magic—the Generator and the Discriminator! 🧙

3. **Training the Wizards:** Join the training extravaganza as our wizards evolve their powers through epochs, conjuring images step by step.

4. **Gallery of Wonders:** Behold the gallery! Wander through the `Generator_Images/` where snapshots of magical moments are preserved after every 1000 training steps.

5. **Epochal Spells:** Dive into the `GIFs/` folder to witness GIFs capturing the metamorphosis of images across different epochs—pure visual sorcery! 🎩🐇

## 📜 Spellbook (Project Structure)

- **`Generator_Images/`:** This realm holds images born from the generator's magic at various steps during its 10-epoch training saga.
