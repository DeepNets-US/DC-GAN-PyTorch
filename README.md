# DCGAN Image Generation

Welcome to the DCGAN Image Generation project! This repository contains the code and results of training a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for image generation.

## Overview

In this project, we explore the potential of DCGANs to generate realistic images. The notebook takes you through the following key steps:

1. **Introduction to DCGAN:** A comprehensive introduction to the concept of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks.

2. **Model Architecture:** Details about the architecture of both the generator and discriminator networks.

3. **Training Process:** A step-by-step walkthrough of the training process, including the generation of synthetic images at various epochs.

4. **Results:** Visualizations showcasing the final model generations, along with GIFs capturing the evolution of images through different training epochs.

## Project Structure

- **`Generator_Images/`:** This folder contains images generated by the model at different training steps (captured every 1000 steps) throughout 10 epochs.

- **`GIFs/`:** Here, you'll find GIFs illustrating the progression of generated images across different epochs.

- **`Notebook/`:** The main notebook file (`DCGAN_Image_Generation.ipynb`) details the entire process, from model creation to training and visualization.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/DCGAN-Image-Generation.git
    cd DCGAN-Image-Generation
    ```

2. **Explore the Notebook:**
    Open `DC GAN MNIST.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

3. **Review Generated Images:**
    - Navigate to the `Generator_Images/` folder to explore images generated during the training process.
    - Check out GIFs in the `GIFs/` folder for an animated view of the model's progress.
